# tensorgrad

Tensorgrad is an automatic differentiation engine with neural network implementations. This is purely to help solidify my understanding of derivatives, automatic differentiation, and neural networks.

This project is not yet completed, and is not completely functional.

I'm looking to work out some of the kinks in Conv2D in the future, which will allow me to test training on MNIST, and make sure my training is up to scratch!
